### Overview

The prefix of each script indicates the order in which the scripts must be run to replicate the analysis (i.e. scripts starting with "2_" rely on a file produced from scripts starting with "1_").

All the data presented in this repository are processed sequence data. Raw sequence data can be found on NCBI under project number XXXXX. The directory `upstream_bioinformatics` contains scripts used in the processing of sequence data, however the actual sequence data are too large to be included here.
