Description of analysis files can be found in `code` directory. The original annotation files are too large to be uploaded to GitHub, if you would like access to these files please contact Pete Chuckran at pete.chuckran@berkeley.edu or pfchuckran@gmail.com. Metatranscriptome data are located on the NCBI database, IMG/M database, and JGI genome portal. Sample names, links to sequence data, and descriptions can be found in the data release (https://doi.org/10.1128/mra.00322-24). MAGs can be accessed from the NCBI database under the BioProject PRJNA856348 and PRJNA718849.
